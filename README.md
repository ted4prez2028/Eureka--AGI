# AGI System

This project implements a comprehensive Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system, integrating various cognitive abilities such as abstraction, creativity, consciousness modeling, memory management, and autonomous decision-making. The system utilizes advanced machine learning models, including deep neural networks and recurrent networks (LSTM), to simulate human-like reasoning, learning, and creativity.

## Features

### Core Modules:
1. **Abstraction** - Solves problems abstractly using generalized knowledge.
2. **Abstract Reasoning** - Uses logic engines for hypothesis testing based on facts and rules.
3. **Advanced Generalization** - Adapts prior models to unknown domains.
4. **Autonomous Creativity** - Generates creative ideas and refines them autonomously.
5. **Goal Management** - Automatically generates and updates goals based on internal states.
6. **Memory Management** - Manages episodic and hierarchical memory.
7. **Ethical Autonomy** - Assesses actions based on a value system and ranks them.
8. **Emergent Behavior** - Simulates evolving strategies from agents interacting with their environment.
9. **Cognitive Flexibility** - Adapts models to specific tasks and contexts dynamically.
10. **Self-Improvement** - Recursively optimizes code for efficiency.
11. **Intrinsic Motivation** - Generates self-improvement goals autonomously.
12. **Subjective and True Consciousness** - Models the AGI's self-awareness and understanding of its actions and outcomes.

### Key Technologies:
- **TensorFlow.js**: Utilized for building deep learning models, including dense layers and LSTM networks.
- **OpenAI API**: Employed for generating abstract solutions, creative ideas, and more.
- **Node.js**: The backend framework, using `express` for routing and `dotenv` for environment variable management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up the environment:
   Create a `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```

## Usage

To start the AGI system, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the command-line interface (CLI), where you can interact with the AGI system. The system will process your inputs and provide responses based on its reasoning, creativity, and learning capabilities.

## API

The system provides several functionalities for different cognitive and reasoning tasks. Below are a few examples:

### Example: Generate Creative Idea

To generate a creative idea:
```js
const { generateCreativeIdeas } = require('./autonomousCreativity');
const result = await generateCreativeIdeas("new tech product");
console.log(result);
```

### Example: Evaluate Intrinsic State

To evaluate intrinsic state deviations:
```js
const { evaluateState } = require('./intrinsicValues');
const state = {
    creativity: { current: 85, expected: 90 },
    adaptability: { current: 70, expected: 80 }
};
const result = evaluateState(state);
console.log(result);
```

### Example: Test Hypothesis

To test a hypothesis using logic-based reasoning:
```js
const { r } = require('./abstractReasoning');
const facts = [{ fact: "data" }];
const rules = [{ rule: "if data then result" }];
const hypothesis = "result";
const result = r(facts, rules, hypothesis);
console.log(result);
```
